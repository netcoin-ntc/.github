# Netcoin-NTC Organization

Welcome to the Netcoin-NTC organization! We are building the future of decentralized networking with energy-backed consensus.

## Repositories

## About Netcoin

Netcoin implements Proof of Network (PoNW), a revolutionary consensus mechanism that makes computational energy productive by embedding proof-of-work puzzles directly into network routing decisions.

### Key Features
- ⚡ **Energy Verification**: PoW puzzles prove real computational work
- 🌐 **Useful Computation**: Routing optimizations serve network utility  
- 💰 **Fair Economics**: Energy input = proportional rewards
- 🔒 **Secure**: 51% attack resistance through energy barriers
- 🏷️ **Premium Aliases**: Unique human-readable addresses

### Vision
Netcoin rethinks digital infrastructure by making decentralized networking economically sustainable. Every routing decision contributes to network security and earns tokens for participants.

## Getting Started

1. **Run a Node**: `git clone https://github.com/netcoin-ntc/netcoin && cd netcoin && make deploy`
2. **Create Wallet**: `netcoin-node wallet create`
3. **Earn NTC**: Nodes automatically mine through routing work
4. **Premium Services**: Use earned NTC for QoS routing, VPN, etc.
